        <p><i>Autumn is the season for rich, creamy sauces, and I'm pretty sure you're going to be shocked at just how easy this one is. When your cream is reduced, your sauce is practically done. I like serving this with a stuffed pasta like tortellini or ravioli, topped with diced apple and crunchy toasted walnuts.</i></p>

        <p>Preparation will take 15 minutes, while cooking will take about 25 minutes, for a total of <b>40 minutes</b></p>

            <li>6 ounces dry miniature ravioli</li>

            <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Pour dried ravioli into boiling water and cook, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender, 16 to 18 minutes. Drain pasta, reserving a cup of pasta water.</li>
